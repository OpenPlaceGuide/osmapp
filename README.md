- master branch: https://osmapp.org
- examples: [Empire State Building](https://osmapp.org/way/34633854#17.00/40.7483/-73.9864), [Prague Castle](https://osmapp.org/relation/3312247#17.00/50.0900/14.4000) or click just anything

## How to contribute 🐱‍💻

You may [add issues](https://github.com/zbycz/osmapp/issues) here on github, or try to update the code in three simple steps:

2. wait few minutes for a preview URL 💬
3. iterate 🔁

Then just wait for a comment from a maintainer.
